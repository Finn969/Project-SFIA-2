## README



## Brief

The core objective of this project was to:
"(create) an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules."

This application would consist of 4 micro-services. Service 1 would be responsible for the HTML page, Services 2 and 3 would generate random objects, and Service 4 would process these objects, generate a new object from them, and send it to Service 1.
Further requirements included:

* A Trello Board featuring tasks to do, and a record of issues and risks.

* Code integrated within a feature-branch version control system, built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based VM.

* The application must be deployed using containerisation (docker) and orchestration (docker-compose/docker swarm) tools.

* An Ansible Playbook to provision the environment in which the application runs.


### My Proposal

My website would generate a horoscope for the user. It would take in their birth date as an input, and return their star sign along with a few short sentences of randomly generated predicitons.

## Trello Board

### Initial Board

My Trello board was primarily based on the Agile concept of a kanban board, but simplified to reflect its usage by a single person. The far left "user stories" column contains the broad features that a user of my application would want to implement. The "backlog" is a formal list of broad tasks which are essential to making the user stories possible. From these broader tasks, more specific tasks that could be completed in a manageable time were identified and listed in the "to do" column. Each task would be added to the "doing" column while in progress, and finally moved to "done" when complete.


### Final Board

The "Problem log" and "Abandoned" columns were present from the start, but unfilled. These kept track of how I decided to treat certain features, if I determined that there was not enough time to fix the problems, I would abandon the feature.

## Risk Assessment

Likelihood and Impact are rated on a scale from 1 to 5. The Matrix in the top right corner shows how the likelihood and impact scores interact; multiplied scores are addressed in order corresponding to red, green and yellow on the matrix.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

My initial plan was built to be rather simple, conatining two main tables to contain battles and generals, with a minor third table which establishes relationships between them, given that pure many-to-many relationships are difficult to implement.

### Initial ERD

I was able to fully complete this structure with some time left over. While my initially planned structure satisfied the MVP, I chose to attempt to satisfy my initally set stretch goals:

### Final ERD

My final structure aimed to show more complex relations: the winner and loser of each battle. This was achieved by inserting additional foreign keys into the battle table, and inserting a new minor table for armies.

## Testing

Using Pytest, I was able to create testing functions in a testing.py file. This file implements only URL tests; URL tests ping each webpage generated by the application, testing that each page is properly generated without without causing a crash.

This testing file is called by Jenkins during each build, and coverage is used to generate a report on how many of the tests are successful.

### Test Report


## Deployment

### Pipeline Diagram

New code would be written on a local machine in VScode. This development environment would then be regularly pushed to a github repository, used to version control the software. A webhook was established between my github repository and my Jenkins server, which would automatically detect any new commits to the repo, and undergo the build/deployment process of the app as a service. The Black parts of the diagram represent intended features that were unable to be implemented in time.

## Retrospective

Given the failure to produce certain goals, I am disappointed in the outcome of this project, but am keen to take the oppurtunity to learn from my mistakes:

* I poorly managed my time, resulting in content being rushed

* I spent a large amount of time trying to implement virtualbox, which proved to be unnecessary, and that time would have been better spent gradually improving the project.

* Poor progress with code resulted in the documentation being rarely updated, resulting in occasional loss of focus.

* I severely underestimated the impact of adjusting to working from home, social isolation coupled with the stress of the project resulted in episodes of severe stress.

However, it is worth noting that I have made some achivements and improvements from my previous project:

* My original plan was not overly ambitious, nor did I spend too much time developing the webapp itself

* I made greater use of the feature-branch model, primarily working within a developer branch.

In summary, I am disappointed in my overall performance, but eager to improve in future projects.
