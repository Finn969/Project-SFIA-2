## README



## Brief

The core objective of this project was to:
"(create) an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules."

This application would consist of 4 micro-services. Service 1 would be responsible for the HTML page, Services 2 and 3 would generate random objects, and Service 4 would process these objects, generate a new object from them, and send it to Service 1.
Further requirements included:

* A Trello Board featuring tasks to do, and a record of issues and risks.

* Code integrated within a feature-branch version control system, built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based VM.

* The application must be deployed using containerisation (docker) and orchestration (docker-compose/docker swarm) tools.

* An Ansible Playbook to provision the environment in which the application runs.


### My Proposal

My website would generate a horoscope for the user. It would take in their birth date as an input, and return their star sign along with a few short sentences of randomly generated predicitons.

## Trello Board

### Initial Board

My Trello board was primarily based on the Agile concept of a kanban board, but simplified to reflect its usage by a single person. The far left "user stories" column contains the broad features that a user of my application would want to implement. The "backlog" is a formal list of broad tasks which are essential to making the user stories possible. From these broader tasks, more specific tasks that could be completed in a manageable time were identified and listed in the "to do" column. Each task would be added to the "doing" column while in progress, and finally moved to "done" when complete.


### Final Board

The "Problem log" and "Abandoned" columns were present from the start, but unfilled. These kept track of how I decided to treat certain features, if I determined that there was not enough time to fix the problems, I would abandon the feature.

## Risk Assessment

Likelihood and Impact are rated on a scale from 1 to 5. The Matrix in the top right corner shows how the likelihood and impact scores interact; multiplied scores are addressed in order corresponding to red, green and yellow on the matrix.

### Wireframe

## Testing

Using Pytest, I was able to create testing functions in a testing.py file. This file implements only URL tests; URL tests ping each webpage generated by the application, testing that each page is properly generated without without causing a crash.

This testing file is called by Jenkins during each build, and coverage is used to generate a report on how many of the tests are successful.

## Deployment

### Pipeline Diagram

New code would be written on a local machine in VScode. This development environment would then be regularly pushed to a github repository, used to version control the software. A webhook was established between my github repository and my Jenkins server, which would automatically detect any new commits to the repo, and undergo the build/deployment process of the app as a service. The Black parts of the diagram represent intended features that were unable to be implemented in time.

## Retrospective

Given the failure to produce certain goals, I am disappointed in the outcome of this project, but am keen to take the oppurtunity to learn from my mistakes:

* I poorly managed my time, resulting in content being rushed

* I spent a large amount of time trying to implement virtualbox, which proved to be unnecessary, and that time would have been better spent gradually improving the project.

* Poor progress with code resulted in the documentation being rarely updated, resulting in occasional loss of focus.

* I severely underestimated the impact of adjusting to working from home, social isolation coupled with the stress of the project resulted in episodes of severe stress.

### Trello of Improvements
![Future Board](https://github.com/Finn969/Project-SFIA-2/blob/master/Documents/Trello3.png)

However, it is worth noting that I have made some achivements and improvements from my previous project:

* My original plan was not overly ambitious, nor did I spend too much time developing the webapp itself

* I made greater use of the feature-branch model, primarily working within a developer branch.

In summary, I am disappointed in my overall performance, but eager to improve in future projects.
